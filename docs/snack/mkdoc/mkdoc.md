# Create Comprehensive Online Documentation

## Best Software

While having a `README` on GitHub is standard for giving an overview of a project and basic instructions, many projects opt for more extensive documentation, especially if they're large or are intended for public or wide-scale internal use. 

Here are some popular options for creating more comprehensive online documentation:

1. **MkDocs**
    - **Description**: It's a fast, simple, and beautiful static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. 
    - **Language**: Written in Python.
    - **Plugin**: With the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, your documentation will have a modern look.
    - **Website**: [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

2. **Sphinx**
    - **Description**: It's a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation. Originally developed for Python documentation.
    - **Language**: Written in Python.
    - **Plugin**: Can be used with [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) for free hosting and automatic builds.
    - **Website**: [www.sphinx-doc.org](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)

3. **Docusaurus**
    - **Description**: It's a project for building, deploying, and maintaining open-source project websites easily.
    - **Language**: Written in JavaScript (React).
    - **Features**: Supports versioned documentation, integrates well with React components for interactive examples.
    - **Website**: [docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/)

4. **VuePress**
    - **Description**: It's a minimalistic static site generator with a Vue-powered theming system.
    - **Language**: Written in JavaScript (Vue).
    - **Features**: Out-of-the-box support for search, and each page generated with VuePress has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing great loading performance and is SEO-friendly.
    - **Website**: [vuepress.vuejs.org](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)

5. **GitBook**
    - **Description**: Offers a modern way to document everything from product specs, to user documentation and API references.

    - **Features**: Nice-looking UI, easy-to-use editor, collaborative editing, and integrates with various tools like GitHub.
    - **Website**: [www.gitbook.com](https://www.gitbook.com/)

6. **Jekyll**
    - **Description**: While it's primarily a blogging tool, many use Jekyll for project documentation especially when hosted on GitHub Pages.
    - **Language**: Written in Ruby.
    - **Features**: If you're already using GitHub Pages, Jekyll can be a natural choice.
    - **Website**: [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

**Is it industry standard?**

Yes, having detailed, user-friendly, and accessible online documentation is certainly an industry standard for sizable or user-facing projects. It ensures that users, developers, and collaborators can understand, utilize, and contribute to the project more effectively. 

Which tool or framework you should use largely depends on your needs, preferences, and the technologies you're familiar or comfortable with. If you're already in the JavaScript ecosystem, for instance, you might opt for Docusaurus or VuePress. If you're a Python developer, MkDocs or Sphinx might be more up your alley. And if you want a platform where everything is set up and maintained for you, GitBook is a solid choice.

## Quick Insight

All of the mentioned documentation tools support writing in Markdown, which is one of the reasons why they are popular choices for developers. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's easy to write and read, making it a favorite for documentation.

Here's a brief recap:

1. **MkDocs**: Uses Markdown exclusively. This makes it easy to get started if you're already familiar with GitHub-flavored Markdown.

2. **Sphinx**: Originally designed for reStructuredText, but it can support Markdown with the help of an extension called `recommonmark`.

3. **Docusaurus**: Supports Markdown out of the box. It also allows you to integrate React components, which can be handy for interactive documentation.

4. **VuePress**: Primarily uses Markdown, with the capability to embed Vue components within your Markdown files, offering greater flexibility for interactive content.

5. **GitBook**: Allows you to write in Markdown. It also provides a user-friendly interface, which makes the writing experience smoother.

6. **Jekyll**: Uses Markdown by default, though it also supports other formats like Textile. When paired with GitHub Pages, it uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.

When choosing a tool, in addition to Markdown support, consider other features you might need (like search functionality, theming, or integrations) and the platform's ecosystem and community support.
